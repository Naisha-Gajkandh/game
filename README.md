This is a fun game called Brain Burst where you enter your name and play brainy mini-games.

There are three games: Quick Math, Word Scramble, and Odd One Out.

You get 10 points for each correct answer.

Your score adds up as you play, and you can check it anytime.

When you exit, your name and score are saved to a file called leader.txt.

The game shows a leaderboard by reading that file.

It only saves your score if it's more than 0.

There's a special display that shows your name and score using a "friend function."

The menu lets you choose what to play or see – it’s simple to use.

When you're done, the game says thanks and ends nicely!
